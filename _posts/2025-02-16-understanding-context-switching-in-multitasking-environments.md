title: Understanding Context Switching in Multitasking Environments

In multitasking environments, efficient task scheduling and execution rely on context switching. Whether switching between 
processes, threads, or coroutines, the operating system (OS) or runtime must save and restore execution states to ensure 
seamless transitions. This article explores the mechanics of context switching across different execution models and their 
impact on performance.

## Process Context Switching

When the OS switches from one process to another, it performs a process context switch, which involves:

1. **Saving the current process state** – The OS stores the execution state, including CPU registers, memory mappings, and 
execution context, in the process control block (PCB).
2. **Selecting the next process** – The scheduler picks the next process to execute based on scheduling policies such as 
round-robin or priority-based scheduling.
3. **Restoring the new process state** – The OS reloads the saved state from the PCB, updates the memory management unit (MMU) 
if needed, and resumes execution.

Since processes have separate memory spaces, switching between them is more expensive than thread or coroutine switching 
due to additional memory management and context restoration overhead.

## Thread Context Switching

When switching from one thread to another within the same process, a thread context switch occurs. The steps involved are:

1. **Saving the current thread state** – The scheduler stores CPU registers such as the program counter (PC), stack pointer 
(SP), and general-purpose registers in the thread control block (TCB).
2. **Selecting the next thread** – The scheduler determines which thread should execute next based on policies like time slicing 
or priority-based scheduling.
3. **Restoring the new thread state** – The CPU restores the saved thread state from the TCB and resumes execution.

Since threads within the same process share memory, thread switching is generally faster than process switching but still 
incurs performance overhead.

## Context Switching in the JVM

In the Java Virtual Machine (JVM), each thread has a dedicated **JVM stack**, which plays a crucial role in method execution 
and memory management. Key functions of the JVM stack include:

### Method Execution & Stack Frames

Each method invocation creates a **stack frame** that contains:

- **Local Variables** – Stores primitive data types, object references, and method parameters.
- **Operand Stack** – Holds temporary values for intermediate calculations.
- **Frame Data** – Contains the method return address and bookkeeping information.

### Thread Isolation

Each thread has its own stack, ensuring local variable isolation and preventing interference between threads, enhancing 
thread safety.

### Method Call & Return Management

When a method completes execution, its stack frame is popped, returning control to the caller method. This process continues 
until the stack is empty or the thread terminates.

### Handling Recursion & Stack Overflow

Deep recursive calls or excessive nested method calls can cause the stack to exceed its allocated size, leading to a **StackOverflowError**.

## Coroutine Context Switching

Coroutine switching, known as **cooperative context switching**, occurs **without OS intervention**, making it more lightweight 
than process or thread switching. The process involves:

1. **Suspending execution** – A coroutine voluntarily suspends execution at a suspension point (e.g., waiting for I/O or delay) 
and saves its state, including the program counter, local variables, and stack frame.
2. **Scheduler selection** – The coroutine scheduler picks the next coroutine based on an event-driven or FIFO strategy.
3. **Restoring execution** – The new coroutine’s state is restored, allowing it to resume from where it last suspended.

### Coroutine Switching in Kotlin

In Kotlin, coroutine switching follows these steps:

- When a coroutine reaches a suspension point (e.g., `delay()`, I/O operation), it saves its execution state in a **continuation object**.
- The coroutine releases the current thread, allowing other coroutines to execute.
- The coroutine scheduler (e.g., `Dispatchers.Default`, `Dispatchers.IO`, `Dispatchers.Main`) determines the next coroutine to execute.
- When the coroutine resumes, the scheduler retrieves its saved state and execution continues seamlessly.

Because coroutine switching avoids OS-level context switching, it is highly efficient for **non-blocking and concurrent applications**.

## Conclusion

Context switching is essential for multitasking, ensuring smooth transitions between processes, threads, and coroutines. 
While **process context switching** is expensive due to memory isolation, **thread switching** is faster but still incurs 
overhead. **Coroutine switching**, on the other hand, is the most lightweight, making it ideal for highly concurrent and 
asynchronous applications. Understanding these differences helps developers choose the best execution model for their 
applications, balancing performance and resource efficiency.
