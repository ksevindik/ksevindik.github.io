I graduated from the Computer Engineering Department of Middle East Technical University (METU) in 1999, and my 
acquaintance with Java dates back to 1998. I have been actively working with Java technologies for over 20 years. 
During this time, I have accumulated extensive knowledge and experience, which I share with participants in areas 
where I am truly an expertâ€”setting myself apart from other educational institutions and trainers in the industry. 
My goal is to deliver distilled insights from my long-standing experience in ways that can provide tangible benefits 
to participants' projects.

I have been working with technologies like the Spring Framework, Spring (Acegi) Security Framework, and Hibernate 
Persistence Framework since their early versions. I have developed numerous solutions with these frameworks and have 
shared my experiences and solutions on various platforms. My areas of interest for many years include object-oriented 
programming, design patterns, aspect-oriented programming (AOP), enterprise web applications, and security topics.

Throughout my career, I have been involved in almost every phase of projects developed with enterprise Java technologies. 
Currently, I am working as a Software Architect at Udemy. I hold certifications such as Java Programmer, Web Component 
Developer, Business Component Developer, and Vaadin UI Framework Developer.

I am one of the authors of the book [Beginning Spring](https://www.amazon.com/author/kenansevindik), published by Wiley Publishing in 2015. Writing and speaking 
engagements have allowed me to share my experiences with software developers across different organizations and seminars 
for years, which I thoroughly enjoy.
